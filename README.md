Persistent Browser Based Game (PBBG) set in an alternate near future in where the COVID-19 mutated and wiped most of the human population.

## Features

So far, only the darknet is functional, as I just started working on this project.

  - [x] Drug trade
    - [x] Drug prices change every 5 hours to a semi-random value. Business 101: Buy low, sell high
  - [ ] Weapon trade
- [ ] **Market** - for buying other stuff
- [ ] **Bar** - this is where you'll get your missions from
- [x] **Wastelands** - area outside the city
  - [x] Scavenging
    - [x] Go scavenging into the wastelands and get some small reward
