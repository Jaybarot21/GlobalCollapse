Persistent Browser Based Game (PBBG) set in an alternate near future in where the COVID-19 mutated and wiped most of the human population.

## Features

So far, only the darknet is functional, as I just started working on this project.

- ~Darknet - black market~
  - ~Drug trade~
    - ~Drug prices change every 5 hours to a semi-random value. Business 101: Buy low, sell high~
  - Weapon trade
- Market - for buying other stuff
- Bar - this is where you'll get your missions from
- Wastelands - area outside the city
  - Scavenging
    - Go scavenging into the wastelands and get some small reward
    - Useful for when you are out of the game for longer time, so that your character does at least something AFK
